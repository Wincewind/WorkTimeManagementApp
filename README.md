# WorkTimeManagementApp
A web app to record work time for projects and keep track of customer invoicing and elapsed workload. Developers record work time done for customer projects which are managed by managers. Projects can have workload or cost limits which cause alerts based on the accumulated invoicing.

Current progress can be viewed online at http://tsoha-worktime-manager.fly.dev/

When signing in, the site might crash sometimes. Reloading the page/signing in again should work. I think it has something to do with the time it takes for the db connections to wake up with fly.io after the apps have been idle for long enough.   

## How to setup and run locally (tested in Uni Linux environment, some steps/commands might be different on Windows or Mac):
1.  Clone the repository or download it as a zip:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wincewind/WorkTimeManagementApp.git
```

2.  In the project folder, create a virtual environment and activate it
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

3.  Install required modules in the virtual env
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4.  Start your PostgreSQL database if it's not running yet and create the required tables in psql using the schema.sql in the root folder.

**Note that this will delete any existing tables of the same name!**
```bash
psql < schema.sql
```

5.  Create .env file for the environment variables and assign appropriate values for them

The values in .env.example should work if it's just renamed to ".env", but generating your own secure SECRET_KEY is **highly** recommended!

6.  The app should now be ready to run start. Remember to change active directory to src folder before running flask
```bash
cd src
```
